Examples

    There are two patterns to IO with PortAudio: Callbacks and BlockingIO. Both are Supported by the
    Library and Relevant Examples are included. Certain more interesting examples require hsndfile
    (audio encoding/decoding based on sndfile).

    Although for the most part callbacks are the standard, they perform poorly if high quality streams
    are required and therefore, we primarily recommend the blockingIO approach.
